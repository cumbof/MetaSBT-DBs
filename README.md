# MetaSBT Public Databases

A collection of public MetaSBT databases with taxonomically organised Sequence Bloom Trees (SBTs) built over curated sets of microbial genomes.

## About databases

Databases are produced with the open-source MetaSBT framework available at [https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT).

MetaSBT databases are nothing else than compressed tarballs containing bloom filter representations of microbial genomes taxonomically organised in SBTs.

In order to make it easier to distribute and install a database, we provide automated procedures implemented as part of the MetaSBT framework called [pack](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/wiki/Available-features#4-pack-pack-a-database-into-a-compressed-tarball) and [unpack](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/wiki/Available-features#9-unpack-install-a-database).

Please look at the official documentation for additional information about how to retrieve the most updated list of public database and how to install them at [https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/wiki/Available-features](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/wiki/Available-features).

> Are you interested in using our software and databases, or building your own private database but lack the necessary computational resources? Get in touch with us – we're always happy to collaborate!

## Contributing

Long-term discussion and bug reports are maintained via GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/discussions) and [Issues](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/issues) under the [MetaSBT framework repository](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT).

Please, (i) be sure that there are no existing issues/discussions concerning the same topic before opening a new issue/discussion; (ii) write a clear and concise description of what the issue/discussion is about; (iii) specifying the list of steps to reproduce the behavior in addition to versions and other technical details is highly recommended.

## Support

Discussions, issues, and PRs are not allowed in this repository.

If you need support, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/issues) or a new [Discussion](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/discussions) under the [MetaSBT framework repository](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT).

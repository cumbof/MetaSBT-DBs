# MetaSBT Public Databases

üì¶ A collection of public MetaSBT databases featuring taxonomically organized Sequence Bloom Trees (SBTs) built from curated sets of microbial genomes.

## üß¨ About the Databases

These databases are generated using the [MetaSBT framework](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT).

Each MetaSBT database is a compressed tarball containing Bloom filter representations of microbial genomes, hierarchically organized into SBTs based on their taxonomic information.

To simplify their distribution and installation, MetaSBT provides automated utilities.
